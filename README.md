p2p4android
===========

This is an Android library for doing peer to peer communications that wraps p2p4java in an Android friendly way.  The protocol is based on a fork of JXTA/JXSE 2.7.

To use this for development:
	* import p2p4android into into Eclipse
	* get the additional libraries required and put them in the /lib folder.  There is a README file there with more information.
	* then you should be compiling the project without errors
